  "dialogue": "At the end of November 2022,, the company OpenAI, released a tool that may change the history of all mankind. What, , is this AI tool that has been reported crazily recently,, and how to, use, it? The background of ChatGPT, is actually an AI chat robot program . Its development company, OpenAI is actually invested by Microsoft. How ChatGPT was born?, You can think of it as a child., Engineers are like adults,, constantly feeding it nutrients. Information, and let it judge what is right and, what is wrong, then, feed it like this,, until now they are open to everyone to use, , it is also a way to train it, a, bit like a social feeling,, so now it is actually a free beta version, All the conversations you have with it can be seen by the official,, , and its answers may be wrong or the text is wrong. Chatbots are, actually no big deal, . ChatGPT is not the first at all., Why is it popular this time? Here we will talk about its, uniqueness. The difference is that, ChatGPT is currently mainly text-based., In addition to chatting,, it can handle very complex language tasks,, such as sorting out the key points from simple jokes and short stories, to more formal writing papers, news, blogs, , resumes, emails, and even writing programs. It's OK,, so basically, any work that requires text input is available, and, the threshold for using ChatGPT is very low,, it's really super simple, you, don't need to know how to program,, you just need to know how to, ask questions, and we will start to teach you how, Before using ChatGPT , let me introduce a few of its great features, . The first one is that it can record your conversations., For example, , in my first question, I, asked it what generation the iPhone is now. In the, next question, I can ask it what, this generation is. Features and so on ,, the dialogue with it can be continuous, and logical, or, it will give you an answer today,, you can ask it to explain or condense the answer just now The, second feature is ChatGPT,, its current answer is limited to before 2021, If you ask it which is the latest iPhone, or what are the latest movies, it can’t answer., The third feature is ChatGPT, , which can support Chinese and multiple languages. However, , there are some small problems in using Chinese., Well, let’s get straight to the point now, . How to use ChatGPT, ? First, let’s look at the website. We search for ChatGPT first., We see that the first website is our today’s protagonist., Let’s click in . After, clicking in Let’s click on Try ChatGPT below,, and if you don’t have an account here,, we can click on the Sign up on the right,, so now we finally enter the main screen of ChatGPT, and you, can see that there are three columns on this side,, which are explaining this C How does hatGPT, work? Some things you should pay attention to. You can, see that the black column on the left, is the topic of your conversation with, it today. Every topic will be posted here., You can go back to the original conversation, which, is a bit It feels like a conversation record., Next , you can see that, there is an OpenAI Discord, . Click, on it and you will jump to a Discord group. You can ask questions or report questions in, it. Next, let’s take a look at how to actually apply ChatGPT, . The first one It is that we will write an article,, and the second we will teach you, how to write an IG Post or blog article. The third, we will teach you how to use ChatGPT, to learn something you want to learn. The, first one is to write an article, Part of it can actually do very detailed things,, from the outline table of contents to the conclusion,, you can ask it to be written,, and when asking questions, there is one thing to pay attention to in Chinese, that, is, you have to type \"\" before each question sentence., Please write in traditional Chinese \", Because if you didn't add this paragraph,, it may answer you in English., I gave an example here, , please write, 10 article titles in traditional Chinese about jobs that, will be replaced by AI. We sent it, out, and here is the title of the article it made. It’s, really pretty good, right?, Let ’s say I’m quite interested in the fifth title,, but I hope it’s making some changes. What should I do?, Here I’ll grab it The 5th point just now,, then ask it to make 5 more similar article titles,, and here it writes 5 similar article titles,, we will choose one of them, and, I will ask it to write, an article in traditional Chinese, A detailed article with the title,, and then we will send it out to see what will happen, . Well, it has already been answered here., This is a very short article. Here we will teach you how to make it create long-form works. How to do, long -form creations., For example, Let's use the title just now., We ask it to write a table of contents or an article outline., Every time I see it writing these things,, I get goosebumps, . Now everyone sees that, it has written a very amazing outline., , And it's so well written that we, can follow each heading of an outline and, we ask it to write a detailed article, like this, say we now want it to write, B. The impact of machine intelligence and, we copy it now Everyone sees that it stops in the middle., This is a shortcoming of Chinese input,, so if you want to ensure that it will not be interrupted,, try to use English as much as possible., Assuming that it, has been created today , I think this sentence, can be written after reading it., What if it's better?, We'll copy it, and paste it, and then we'll make it into a sentence., Let's try it in English (Rephrase), and it writes exactly the same meaning,, but in a different way, . If, you, think it is not long enough or too short after it finishes writing this text today,, you can ask it to extend the description narrate or shorten some sentences., For example, , let’s ask it to extend the description, of this sentence about the development of machine intelligence, . Now let, ’s try to let it condense the content just now into one sentence, . In, this way, you can write a very long article., This method can be used, whether it, is news or papers, etc., Of course, I think the most perfect way, is to ask you to refine it after it is finished. It will, look more natural. Next, let’s see how to make it write out The content of IG posts or blogs is also very interesting., Our first step is to choose the title and, ask it to write 10 attractive IG post titles, . In fact, any content or subtitle can be requested. It's written, , let's choose the tenth title here, let 's ask it to create the content, it's, too strong, , even # is ready for you,, let 's try to write a blog post now,, okay here Ask a question, Please write 10 interesting, blog articles related to software technology. The title, is, , the keyword \"interesting \"., Adjectives like \"attractive\" and, \"sensational\", would make it a little more lively, Let's send it out and see, , okay, now, it really scares me every time we, answer, let's pick a title, let's, say I want to pick a sixth virtual reality, and I'll, ask it to write an article, about virtual reality opening up new worlds The blog post, assuming, it’s finished now, , if you want to ask it to expand more,, you can post the sentence, and then ask it to expand to describe other content like this., The last one is to teach everyone how to use ChatGPT to learn things., This part is actually a bit contradictory, because Sometimes the information on ChatGPT, is not 100% correct,, so there are still risks in using this method,, but I think it is very helpful in learning the, language. For example, if I want to learn quantum mechanics today,, we can Ask it to say something about quantum mechanics,, as we said earlier,, it may answer you in English,, well,, it has finished answering now,, and I am confused now, so, we can ask it to explain, it in a very simple way, The answer I think is really awesome, because it is, explained to a 5-year-old child in a very simple way,, or any language you want to learn today, , you can ask it to make unlimited sentences, to help, you understand how this word is used Or How to use this phrase, so I think ChatGPT, has a very wide range of applications., Today , no matter all walks of life , as long as the text is used, it will benefit a lot,, whether it is an advertising slogan, marketing copywriting,, or even packaging., You can use this to produce the above text,, so if you have any application you want to see, , please also suggest to me in the comment area below., I can also make some fun videos to share with you. Our teaching today is here., If you think this video is not bad, you, , can give me a like,, subscribe and turn on Tinkerbell,, we will see you next time bye"
