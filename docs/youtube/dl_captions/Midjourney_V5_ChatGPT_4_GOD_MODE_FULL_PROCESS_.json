  "dialogue": "we're going to be putting mid Journey, version 5 and chat tpt4 together to, harness the great powers that they, contain and we're going to be building, better prompts and making the most of, these new technologies we can imagine a, chat gpt4 as a wise wizard who has, trained for many years we can go to the, wise Wizard and ask him to Define us and, articulate and specific prompt for, different contexts dear wizard can you, give me a prompt for a sweet lady, protagonist for my film about cheese of, course young Padawan just put 8K at the, end, to perform this process we will train, chat gpt4 in the art of prompt writing, and help refine its outputs after this, we'll look at how these prompts come out, in mid-journey and look for ways to, improve our prompt writing wizard so, let's Dive Right In the first step is to, come to chat GPT make sure we set the, model to chat gbt4 and start a new, conversation, and what we're going to do is we're, going to Prime chat gpt4 to act as our, wizard prompt writer and to do that I'm, going to inform it that you need to act, as a prompt engineer you will write me, prompts for an air generator called, mid-journey, I will provide you with short content, ideas and your job is to elaborate these, into full explicit coherent prompts so, here I've defined the task I've told it, what it's going to act is and now I'm, giving it more context around what an AI, art generator is what a prompt is and, how I would like the response formatted, prompts involve describing the content, and style of images it is useful to be, explicit and use references to popular, culture artists and mediums your focus, needs to be on nouns and adjectives this, prevents chat GPT from going off and, describing in Flowery ways the vacant, gaze that somebody's having that reminds, them of the first day of autumn and, we're asking chat gbt to actually Define, what that would look like that the eyes, are focused on something in the distance, rather than they have a vacant stare I, love to think of these prompts as, casting spells into mid-journey and with, the right combination nation of words we, can elicit infinite possibilities when, guardian mid journeyosa, [Music], I then go on to tell it I will give it, some example prompts to use please, define the exact camera that should be, used, it's useful to get an exact camera lens, if that is the medium you're using, because it helps Define the precise, aesthetic that we're looking for I then, gone on to say here is a formula for to, use brackets content insert nouns here, medium insert artistic medium Here style, insert preferences to genres artist and, popular culture here lighting reference, the lighting here, colors reference the color styles and, palettes here composition reference the, camera's specific lenses shot types and, positional elements here, what I've done is broken The Prompt down, into specific variables so that we will, make sure we get adjectives relating to, these different component parts of an, effective prompt this will make sure, that we have accurate defined language, for the whole Ray of possibilities of, our prompt when giving a prompt remove, the brackets speak in natural language, and be more specific use precise and, articulate language always output me to, full prompt options this means it will, get two options every time we ask for a, prompt so this can be great for, simultaneously creating different images, inside of mid-journey and it also gives, us a little bit more flexibility to, either choose one or the other or even, combine parts of both into our own, unique prompt finally I've given it one, example prompt to give it an idea of how, I would like the output to be to get the, most out of chat TPT it's import, important to give it a lot of contextual, information chat gpt4 now takes up to 25, 000 characters in contextual information, and this allows us to give it a lot more, information which then can include in, its own intelligence allowing us to give, it a lot of information and asking it to, reflect and interpret that in original, ways an interesting use case that I, recently saw was somebody took a new, feature from a coding language and, inputted the entire documentation into, chat GPT form and asked it to spit out a, tutorial that was aimed at beginners so, we're taking really Advanced complex, language and we're asking chat gbt to, Output us a more accessible version of, that information so let's take a look at, the content that we've got from chat GPT, for our first prompts, first one is, a tranquil underwater landscape medium, oil painting style inspired by jmw, Turner are the great Turner, and H.R Geiger, so turn up was an English painter who, specifically worked in oil paints and, created a very beautiful atmospheric, seascapes, now the first thing I noticed is that it, still included the brackets so I will, retrain chat gbt by asking it to rewrite, the prompts without brackets but, brackets are the answer young boy I know, more than you wizard, okay so this is looking much better what, we're going to do is we're going to copy, this prompt and we're going to hop into, mid Journey we're going to make sure, that we're using version 5 for the, algorithm and we're going to type in, forward slash imagine paste in our brand, new prompt and this is going to spit us, out something quite remarkable and, simultaneously we can come back and do, the second idea as well now these are, just ideas we've asked from chatgpt but, what we can also do is we can ask it to, do something of our own volusion so I'm, going to ask Chachi BT for a vintage, travel poster of the Alps let's see how, it gets on with this request and we're, going to hop back into my journey and, see how it's getting on with our, original requests so the first prompt we, put in was a tranquil, underwater cityscape, oil painting by jmw, Turner with warm ethereal Sunset, lighting filtering through the water the, colors should be rich blues teals and, warm oranges capture the scene with a, wide angle lens and it's created a, pretty interesting concept piece here, let's upscale a couple of these wow it's, fantastic how it's got this, juxtaposition between the, underwater scene and the cityscape on, top and the second prompt I put in was a, futuristic garden party with robots and, people mingling is in the style of, Alfonso Musha who is a very popular, artist imitate he had an art deco style, and created a number of stylistic, advertisements in the early 20th century, also please forgive me on the, pronunciation of his name I believe I, always butcher it but for the record, Alphonse mucha mucha Alphonse mucha is, the British Alphonse mucha, and if you're interested the American, Alphonse mucha alfonse mucho, okay enough of that tangent let's get, back to our Alphonse mucha robotic, Garden Party, and upscale a couple of these for a, closer inspection and you can see we've, got this very distinctive interesting, concept of a robotic party in the style, of Alphonse mucha I like it but I, essentially try the prompt that we've, asked it for, so now we're going to look at our, vintage travel posters, I'm also going to change the aspect, ratio for this and make it vertical so, for that I'll change it to dash dash AR, 2x3 which means that we're going to have, a poster outputted and for every 200, pixels of width we're going to have 300, pixels of height now we're going to go, again with the second option, and try that again with a 2x3 ratio, in the meantime we're going to whack, another one inside of a tadji BT this, time we're going to go for, street photography portraits in New York, mid-journey version 5 has really taken, the levels and quality of AI art to new, heights and specifically photorealism, has increased immensely the details on, finer elements of human anatomy are now, so precise that it's becoming harder and, harder to distinguish between AI art and, real photography one thing that was, rendered particularly well inside of my, journey now is hair strands of hair, wait do you get to my age and I'll show, you the meaning of hair boy, wow and look at these beautiful vintage, style posters that we've now gotten, outside of mid-journey absolutely, mesmerizing these would work really well, for home decor if you're interested in a, business idea I can suggest creating, very specific travel posters for, different locations and opening an Etsy, Shop really targeted at a specific place, that has a high number of rental, properties because Airbnb renters love, to put specifically inspiring artworks, that are relevant to a space on their, walls I think that is a great, opportunity to monetize a piece of work, like this wow look at that one I adore, it the the colors and the composition, are fantastic, and I really like the difference we've, got between the two options with the, first being slightly more saturated with, these brighter Reds and a second having, a more nuanced approach with these more, pastel colors, now you may have noticed that still the, text is being rendered pretty, horrendously inside of mid journey and, this is something that hasn't been, improved very much in version 5. one, thing they did mention is that they are, trying to remove unnecessary text where, possible and there is some notion of, that happening and there is less text, appearing in a lot of places but what we, can always do is take an image like this, and really help ourselves Stand Out by, actually adding our own text you can use, a free tool like figma to easily add our, own text you can paste an image in, easily and what we're going to do here, is actually we're just going to crop the, image by drawing a frame with the F key, and pasting the image inside this Frame, then we're going to extend, the image upwards to give us some room, at the top to input, our own text we're going to put in our, own writing I'm going to try chamonix, here pick a suitable font I'm going to, choose pins this time make the font size, all the way up to 160, change the font style to, bold and we're going to select a color, from inside of the artwork, make sure that we've got the whole word, on one line and I'll slightly increase, the letter spacing when you're using all, caps it's important to slightly increase, the letter spacing, [Music], check my spelling of chamonix there and, I am correct Christ being dyslexic sucks, thank God for AI but one should not, blame or one's ills of poor spelling on, dyslexia you can quickly take an image, and actually vastly improve the quality, that you have by adding your own text, this is something that AI is massively, struggling with still and it's very, interesting to see that it has overcome, the issues with hands and guns yet text, is still something that it is suffering, with another area the V5 is still not, able to deal with is being able to, create specific elements remember them, and put them on future works for example, you could create a character and then, reuse the same character in future the, same goes with objects and locations but, that's something hopefully we'll see, before too long but here is my vintage, travel style poster generated with mid, journey and chat TBT but let's have a, little look at how are getting on with, our street photography wow these are, beautiful absolutely mesmerizing really, but you can also give chat GPT the, opportunity to come up with its own, ideas, so I've asked it to give me five varied, ideas include two that are, photorealistic and one of a beautiful, woman and we'll take a look at the, artwork that Chad gbt wanted to make, what does the AI desire hot air balloon, scenes wow wonderful French Countryside, and for the beautiful woman it has, a it has a Japanese woman in traditional, attire it's interesting that I would say, perhaps there is an inbuilt bias there, in chat gbt to give us a very diverse, output rather than a very perhaps narrow, version of the most likely output and, then we have a wonderful Street Scene so, thank you for GPT for your contribution, to the art here I love just scrolling, through the mid-journey Community Feed, and seeing what people come up with and, you would have to say that at least half, of the images that are generated are, based around attractive women, which is great because I love attractive, women they can also ask chat gbt for its, opinion on why is the majority of art, created based on attractive women and, chat gbt has told us that the prevalence, of attractive young women in AI, generated art can be attributed to, several factors reflecting both the, biases within the AI itself and the, preferences of the users should we, address this I don't think we should I, don't think there's an issue with people, choosing to create beautiful women but, it is something that happens if anything, it's very interesting for me that I on, one hand I enjoy looking at attractive, young women but it seems almost, fleetingly enjoyable it's a bit it is, like watching pornography that it is fun, but it's very Hollow I think there is, more depth more Nuance more Beauty to be, found in other places creativity comes, from combining Tools in original ways, and using the strengths of chat gbt and, mid-journey allows us to create Advanced, articulate prompts check out my AI, courses in the description below and, make sure to watch this video next for, more on the state of AI"
