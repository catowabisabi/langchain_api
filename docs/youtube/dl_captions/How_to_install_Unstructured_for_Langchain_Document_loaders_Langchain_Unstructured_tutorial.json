  "dialogue": "in this video we're going to be learning, how to properly install unstructured for, link chain so that we can deal with many, document types for example loading of, regular files like dot Pi files.txt, files or dot Json files also the, problematic one.pdf files so we will be, able to use PDF files at the end of this, and also just image files we'll be able, to read the text out of images, and also URLs you'll be able to read the, text out of URL I'll be putting all the, links that I'm showing you in the, description first of all we need to read, the manual for installing unstructured, from Lang chain, there's some instructions but they are, not fully complete I'm also using, minikonda for my virtual environment, setup but you can use anything you like, you're gonna have to install git, you can install it by going to the link, provided and go to downloads and select, it for your system we're going to be, installing it for Windows you need to, install pytorch, just go to pytorch get started locally, and select your options and you'll get, the command or pip install it, also we're going to be you should read, the installation instructions which are, at the unstructured as well but I found, this medium article which was much, easier for me to install the text round, part of it so I'll be using that, we also need Poplar we need to download, it and then unzip it and place it in our, working directory using 7-Zip I'll put, all these links in the description we, also need Tesseract we'll just need to, download it both for this Tesseract and, for Poplar we're gonna have to place, them in our path environment variable as, well I will be putting all these, instructions in patreon as a post for my, patreon supporters but let's begin first, we need to create a condo environment, using this command to use this command, in Visual Studio code you're going to, need to come here with this arrow and, create a command prompt, and I have already actually created a, virtual environment named Mouse, structure you can name it anything you, like so normally we just paste this here, this will create a new virtual, environment named as structured with the, python version which you specify in this, case we are using 3.10 next is to, activate the environment which you have, created, so you would just copy this and paste it, here I have deactivated my environment, so we can see so after that we'll be in, your virtual environment of name of your, choosing in this case a structure it is, best to upgrade your setup tools and, upgrade pip you just would have to copy, these commands and paste them into your, command prompt in Visual Studio code or, your Standalone command prompt this will, upgrade your setup tools and the next, command will upgrade your pip install, if you get a permission error with Pip, upgrade then use the exact same command, with Dash user at the end of it after, that we installed the regular length, chain and open AI you would just, paste it and run it as you'll see I, already have a requirement to satisfied, because I have already done this you, would have to do the same for pip, install openai, and I put in the instructions here that, please do read the length chain, documentation on unstructured file, uploader and also the installation, instructions at unstructured, after that just go to the gits website, and then download it and install it I, have followed it's a bit of a complex, install but I haven't changed anything, in the default installation except, pointing it to my visual studio code IDE, a install unstructured local inference, again this is same as everything else, pip install unstructured local inference, I have already done this so I won't, install it if you end up getting for, whatever reason an error related to, numpy then upgrade your numpy for detect, run, you would do this with Pip install numpy, upgrade but I'm I'm hoping that this, won't be necessary for most people after, that we picked install sighton and then, pip3 install torch torch Vision torch, audio this is the instruction we have, gotten from the Torches website, keep in mind that this will only install, the torch for CPU use so it'll be slower, so if you want if you have a good GPU, and you want to use it then you can, actually install it with GPU support as, well, you will just need the instruction to, Cuda 11 6 or 11 7 and then you would use, this command for GPU support next we'll, be using the medium article I mentioned, for installing detect runt I'm so glad I, ran into this it actually creates an, environment which we have already done, and the pistol python comes from there, and after that the instructions is to, use git to clone the detectron, repository into your working, folder here we have done this right here, detectoral control folder exists after, that we type in CD detectron on our, Command Prompt to get into that folder, like this and we will enter the detector, on folder, after that you have to pip install Dash, e you have to include the dot in the end, don't forget that, from the folder which is the top, detector onto after you've done this and, you back away from that directory by, doing cd.dot and return to your working, directory instruction is here and then, you will install pip install opencv Dash, python after that you pip install layout, parser layout models and Tesseract then, we continue with Pip installing, python-magic first and the PIP install, python magic Dash pin next, then we go and download the 7-Zip from, 7zip.org this is to unzip the file which, we will be downloading From Poplar the, link is here it will also be in the, description this is the download popular, for Windows, after you download Poplar unzip it and, place it into your working directory, just like this here we have done it in, the visual studio code and then you have, to take note of where the bin directory, is you can copy that just like right, clicking and copy path you just have to, get the path in your hard drive to this, directory and then you would have to add, it into your environment variable path, to add the popular spin directory path, to your environment path variable you, have to go to Windows search for, environment and select the edit the, system environment variables, I'm just using the text manager so it'll, block my opening eye keys and whatnot, anyway once once you're here click the, environment variables and this window, pops out and down here you would have to, go to path and then click edit, and from here you would have to add a, new one and just paste the path right, here and then by clicking ok just get, out of it I have done this right here, the second line is for Poplar, so this is the path we're talking about, it drags to the poplar's bin directory, foreign, vs code by right clicking copying the, path and if you do that as you can see, it'll give you the path and this is what, you'll have to put in that path, environment variable, after that you'd have to go to, tesseract's GitHub Tesseract is a, Windows installer just download it and, install it there are instructions, probably for other operating systems too, I have downloaded the 64-bit and, installed it while you're installing, make sure the path which you are, installing Tesseract to because you're, going to have to put this into your, environment path variable as well just, like we have done for Poplar after it is, installed and after you have it in your, path then just simply pip install pipe, this array like this so this is pretty, much it this should cover for what we, were looking for anyway I have skipped, LibreOffice lib XML and libx sdslt, libreoffices for Word documents and, stuff like that I will put these links, in the description if you want to look, into it just as I have if you want of, document support, but last thing which you must not forget, is to actually execute this code which, is to install nltk dependencies for, unstructured you have to run this, command it will download the punked and, then you have to import an ltk and then, on the average perceptron tagger after, which time we should restart your vs, code and make sure your unstructured, environment is active in vs code by, checking python interpreter by clicking, Ctrl shift p, so if you press after you've done all, this now you can actually just start, loading the documents of your choice you, just have to import the unstructured, file loader which I'm using in this case, and we're also going to be using the, unstructured URL loader I've selected, some files here's a python file called, the test underscore Bash from blank, chain Json file it's a Wikipedia article, about physics and start bash is just a, unit test and then a PDF of the language, models or flu shot Learners paper which, inspired the retention-based large, language models and also an image we're, going to be also using this image so, let's just demo this real quick first, we're loading test.bash and then, assigning it to a loader using, unstructured file loader after that, we're assigning docs to loader.load, which we have defined right here and, then we're just printing the document up, to 100 characters let's just turn 200, and then we just run it, please see when you run this you get the, first 200 characters from the this Pi, file right here which means that we were, able to successfully load the document, next let's take a look at the Json file, and then save the file and run it, and we were able to load this document, successfully as well, next let's try the PDF save the file and, run it, doing this with PDF especially if you're, using the CPU version of torch takes a, while it can take a couple of minutes, for long files because it's using a lot, of image recognition and also object, character recognition OCR so I'm just, gonna have to wait I'm assuming the GPU, version would be much faster with the, GPU version of pytorch installed, typically a minute or two but it was, able to load the paper and print the, first 200 characters so loading PDF is, successful as well let's try an image so, he's just going to be reading the text, out of this image just give the name of, the file because it's in our working, directory let's just run this, now here we go this is very cool we were, able to read file image file, infographics to use striking engaging, visuals communicate information quickly, and clearly and if you look right here, make sure that's what it says right up, here, this is pretty awesome, and finally let's comment this uh file, loader out and on comment our URL loader, I'm just I've just put in two URLs from, the link chain documentation, so if you save this and run it we'll be, able to get the text out of these two, documents and load it for use in blank, chain and as you see we have done just, that this is pretty quick, so this is awesome so this really covers, most of the documents that you probably, need to deal with if you need to deal, with Office Microsoft Office documents, you need to look into installing Library, office, but other than that this should be, pretty cool I'll put these instructions, for my patreon supporters to patreon but, feel free to install everything from the, video all the instructions are here, please join the echo hype server I'll, put that in the description as well all, the links necessary will be in the, description please let me know what you, think in the comments I'll see you in, the next video I hope this is helpful"
