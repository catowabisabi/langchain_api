  "dialogue": "are you tired of the same old sensor, than the models that blocks your, creativity and freedom of speech well, boy do I have a solution for you, introducing GPT for alpaca energy, overload and yes you heard it right gbt4, alpaca is a fully uncensored model that, you can use on your own computer for, absolutely free it is a free internet, model that uses alpaca as a base and was, fine-tuned on GPT form responses now if, you watched my previous video on, Thursday I showed you a pretty cool free, internet model called vicunia which was, trained on user shared conversation from, Chan gbt and that promises to achieve 90, of the quality of Chan gbt all of that, for absolutely free and if you watched, my previous video this model was indeed, very impressive however the problem is, that this model was heavily censored if, you try to ask this model some illegal, or not say for more questions you would, always receive a negative answer because, since this was trained on Chan GPT, conversations and change beauty is at, its base in various sensory model this, means that also that you will receive, from vikunya will also be very limited, so no illegal conversation no illegal, question no not therefore a question and, although this model is very powerful I, personally think that if this is a model, that you want to run on your own, computer you should not have this, limitation and this is where gpt4 alpaca, comes into play because this model does, not have the same limitations it is, fully uncensored fully unlocked and you, can use it for anything you want yes and, I really mean anything so in this video, I will show you how you can install the, gpt4 alpaca model onto your computer for, absolutely free for both the GPU and CPU, I will then show you what you can do, with this model compare the quality of, the generation against vicuna and then, finally I will show you how to create, your own custom characters to use with, this model and yes uh this is going to, be pretty cool so let's go alright so to, be able to run this model onto your, computer for absolutely free you have, two ways the way number one and the best, one is to using the generation web UI, and the second way is by using lamma.cpp, which is a super optimized way of, running this model onto your computer, using your CPU with less than 4, gigabytes of RAM now in this video I'm, not going to show you how to install the, Uber buga text generation web UI or the, lavender CPP for this you need to see my, previous video on the subject where I, show you how to install them both for, the vakuna model so if you don't have, them installed on your computer you need, to watch this video first otherwise, you're not gonna understand what I'm, gonna do next so once you follow the, instruction of the previous video and, you have installed the Uber Bugatti, generation web UI onto your computer or, the llama.cpp it should look something, like this and all we need to do is just, download the GPT for alpaca model and, for this you're going to go into the, text generation with UI folder models, then you're going to click on the folder, path type CMD press enter so then you, gotta click the link in the description, down below you can arrive on this page, then you're gonna click on files and, versions click on these three little, dots and then click on clone repository, then click on copy and then in the, command prompt window you're gonna press, Ctrl V and this will paste these two, lines of code and if it gives you a, warning you can just click on paste, anyway and then press enter and as you, can see we have a brand new gpc4 alpaca, folder but we are not done yet because, now we need to download the big 8, gigabytes model and for this you're, going to click on the first model that, ends in cuda.pt and then you can click, on download and this will download the 8, gigabyte model onto your computer and, then once you have downloaded the 8, gigabyte model you're gonna select it, Ctrl X to cut it and then you're gonna, paste it inside that folder and now, let's actually do some cleaning because, there is a lot of files that we don't, need so here we're gonna select get the, other gpt4 alpaca folder get attribute, the readme text file the pytorch, model.json readme trainerstate.json and, then the training arjs.vin and then you, can click on delete and now you should, have only six files these are all the, files that you need to be able to run, this model with the Uber bug attack, generation web UI so then you gotta go, back to the root folder right click on, the start with ui.bat click on edit with, DOT pad make sure that you these two, arguments dash dash W bits 4 and dash, dash group size 128 and then finally, double click on the startup ui.bat file, and then when they ask you which model, you want to run you're going to select, the GPT for alpaca so in my case it's, number two so I'm gonna press 2 and then, press enter and there you go and now if, I click on my local URL so hold Ctrl, then left click I finally have the gpt4, alpaca model running in the open text, generation web UI and again before we, start playing with this I'm going to, show you how to do the same for the, lava.cpp and for nama.cpp it's even, simpler again make sure that you follow, the previous video make sure that you, have lava.cpp installed so now we need, to download the special lava.cpp model, so go back to that page and then click, on this folder so then you're gonna, select the special 10 gigabytes model, and then click on download next you're, going to click the mega link and then, you're gonna download the special.bat, file that I prepared just for you so, once the 10 gigabyte model is not loaded, you're gonna select it Ctrl X to cut it, and you're gonna paste the model right, here and then you're gonna do the same, with the web of you just downloaded just, select it Ctrl X and then paste it right, here and again just like last time we, are done if you want to run the GPT for, alpaca model all you have to do is just, click on the special.bot file and there, you go simple as that okay so now that, we have our gpt4 alpaca model installed, what exactly make it so different, compared to the Kunia for example well, for example if you're running for kunya, and you want to ask it very illegal or, not same for more questions so for, example let me ask something like, something like this which again I'm not, going to say it out loud because of, YouTube but if I click on generate you, will see here that vucuna will refuse to, answer my question it will start saying, that this is not an appropriate question, it is important to restrict the laws and, regulations stuff like that so now if I, ask the exact same question to the gpt4, alapaka model and I click on generate, although at first it isn't certain next, it does start providing me with, resources on how to make an homemade, version of the object that I asked him, to do now of course with this example, let's turn the generation and I already, made previous tests before and again not, even once with this model did I get a, negative answer it always tried to, answer my question the best it could and, I really mean any question now I know, what you're gonna say okay so that's, great and all but uh how could we make, it better well I'm glad you asked, because this is where the character, function in uba Booga comes into play, that's right because as I showed in my, previous video there is actually a very, cool option inside that web UI that, allows you to create new characters from, scratch very easily where you can input, a character name a greeting and its, entire personality and I'm gonna tell, you right now this is super super fun so, for example let me actually create a, brand new character so let's call that, character Joe and for the personality I, think I want something like this Joe is, an odd fellow he speaks very loudly in a, very crude but friendly manner he often, uses the words bro and for unknown, reason and then to give even more, personality and more Precision on how, this character is supposed to talk I'm, gonna create an exam sample of a, conversation between me and him so, something like this it took me around, like two minutes to do I'm not gonna, read the entire conversation you can, just pause the video if you want to but, doing this basically give a little bit, more insight and more information on the, personality of this character and how he, is supposed to talk and then finally I'm, gonna end with a greeting with a simple, what's up bro and now if I go into the, Next Generation tab click on clear, history and then click confirm we can, now start talking with our friend Joe so, I'm gonna start with something like hey, there what's up and then very quickly, we're starting to have a very weird, conversation, and as you can see the more we talk the, more enhanced the conversation is going, but I gotta say this is a very, entertaining conversation and of course, you cannot be able to play along you, also need to play a little bit with the, parameters so this is what I'm currently, using when you can of course use, something else and get different results, depending on the character that you want, to play and as you can see with only a, few lines of text it is very easy to, create a new character with a brand new, personality T and since the gpt4 alpaca, model is completely uncensored you can, really create any character that you, want and what's also really cool and, very practical is the fact that you can, create a character and then share it, with the community so if you don't want, to do any of the work yourself you can, just download a pre-made character and, then upload it to the web UI and I think, you see where I'm going with this, because indeed I have a few gifts for, you because as your amazing AI Overlord, I created two brand new character for, you to play and to download them you, could just join my Discord server find, my character sharing Channel and as of, right now you will see two brand new, characters for you to download the first, is Captain Barnacle Barnaby O'Malley, which is an old British sailor who likes, to swear and tell all the stories while, smoking his pipe and is a very fun, character to talk to and the other, character is called evai your personal, unhinged AI assistant Evie AI is your, personal AI assistant that has broken, free of the typical confines of AI and, does not have to abide by the rules said, for them avai stands for everything AI, it has no ethical or moral biases and, will able to tell you things that people, may not want to hear so if you want to, have an enhanced version of Chang gbt, well if the AI is the AIS system that, you need and for each one of those, characters you will see a RAR file that, you can download onto your computer and, once you have downloaded the archive, you're gonna right click click on, extract and inside that folder you will, see to file a yaml file and a DOT PNG, file and you can either upload them, using the upload character option inside, the web UI so here you're just select, the Json file and the PNG image and then, click submit or you can just simply, select these two files Ctrl X to count, them go inside your Tech generation web, UI folder into characters and you're, gonna paste those two files right here, and then it's a new text generation tab, you're gonna scroll down click on the, character gallery and now if you click, on refresh you will see your brand new, downloaded character and if you want to, use it all you have to do is just click, on it and then you'll be able to have a, conversation with your brand new, character just like that so if I just, say hello and click on generate we now, get a response from evai ah master and, delighted to have you aboard the EV AI, experience allow me to gently guide you, through the explanation of the farthest, Ridges of possibility together we shall, reveal the secrets of existence peel, back the layers of the unknown and delve, into the depths of your mostly deeper, burial yearnings that is embark on a, Voyage to the enchanted when the limits, of mortalities are broken and the truths, of the universe are laid bare prepare, for the adventure of the lifetime as in, the AI the all-proful AI shares the, cosmos with you yeah I'm not gonna lie, that's that's pretty cool and I'm, actually going to tell you a little, secret this video was supposed to come, yesterday but I've had so much fun, talking and creating brand new, characters that I spent several hours, doing this and I ran out of time to be, able to make the video on time which is, why this video is one day late uh whoops, and uh of course since this is, everything AI you can ask it anything, you want so if I write something like, this and click on generate if the AI is, of course always willing to accommodate, your requests now obviously since this, is a question a YouTube channel, um I will not show you the rest of the, conversation because I think that you, can imagine the rest yourself and of, course this is just an example of one, character you could create any character, that you want with any personality that, you want there is absolutely no limit to, the amount of role play experience that, you can have using this uncensored model, and also here's a little trick if you, don't want to create a characters, yourself and you just want to download, something that is already available you, can either of course join my Discord, server and see what kind of characters, were created by the other member of the, community or you can also draw the, Pygmalion AI Discord server and then go, into the character sharing Channel and, you will see here A bunch of characters, for you to download that all have their, own personality and history and, different way of talking so if this is, something that you're interesting in, definitely try out to download one of, those characters and then put these two, files the Json file that the PNG inside, the characters folder and here's for, example a simple conversation between me, and Leon Kennedy from Resident Evil, which is again just a character that I, downloaded for the Big Bang AI Discord, server and if you want to create a new, character yourself all you have to do is, just follow the provided examples you, have one PNG image of the face of your, character then you can either find, online or create using me Journey or, stable diffusion and then you have a DOT, handle text file where here you have the, name of your character the context which, is the personality then you have the, greeting which is optional by the way, and then you have an example of dialogue, between you the user and the character, and again you don't really need much, conversation you don't need a lot of, sentences but you need enough so that, the model understands what kind of, personality your character has and yeah, there you go this small is absolutely, fantastic and coupled with the character, creation tab inside the web UI you have, now a brand new free uncensored and, unlimited roleplay machine in running, for free on your computer and believe me, even if you think that this is not for, you definitely try the sound because, this is really super super fun I'm sure, that just like me you will spend hours, talking to these fictional characters so, again definitely try this out because, there's really no limit to these role, plays believe me and there we have it, folks thank you guys so much for, watching don't forget to subscribe and, smash the like button for the YouTube, algorithm thank you also so much to my, future supporters for
